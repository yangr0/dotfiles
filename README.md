My configuration files for ArcoLinuxB (i use arch btw) + bspwm + polybar + alacritty + zsh + neovim

# WARNING

These configs were made to suit my system and my system only

Copy and pasting the entire config file will most likely be very buggy or not work at all for you

Make sure to look through the files and make any necessary tweaks
